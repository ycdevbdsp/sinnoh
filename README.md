## Loading Matrix

The author of this application makes the assumption that you have a general idea of what you're trying to do, and will not provide instructions on how to acquire the data that this application can modify.

However, assuming you do have that, select File > Load and select the **folder** that contains the map matrix files (hint: they are JSON files)
It supports data exported with UABEA or AssetStudio, provided they are all exported from the same application and exported as JSON.

## Editing Cells

Select any cell and its data will fill in the fields on the left. Make any necessary changes and save them by clicking the Save Cell button.
Save all changes to the matrix by clicking the Save Matrix button.

The width and height of the matrix can be edited by using the boxes near the bottom left. Unset matrix cells will appear red and will stay red until explicitly set otherwise.
